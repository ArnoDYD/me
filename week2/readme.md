TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I was able to finish ex0-2 in the lab. I could do more but there were other thing that took the time of the lab. I spent about 4 hopurs on ex3. I do have some comments on ex3. Understanding the mechanism of the code is important and it would save me more time. For example, the 10*10 star field question. At first I though that we need some code to turn every list into a new line. And I even looked for the code \n on google. It's about 30 mins later that my firend told me that I do not need to do such a thing since append a list into a list seems turn into a new line itself. It's ok in the end but I think I will get along with it better as I get use to this kind of question style.
